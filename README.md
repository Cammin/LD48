# LD48
My game for Ludum Dare 48

### Personal goals I've set out to do:
- Learn Unity's new Input system better (Trying to learn how to use it simply instead of overengineering it due to not understanding the package enough)
- Learn [Unity Atoms](https://unity-atoms.github.io/unity-atoms/) and evaluate it's usefulness
- Make my own pixel art in Aseprite and integrate to Unity with [Aseprite2Unity](https://github.com/Seanba/Aseprite2Unity). Simple pixel art, and only after I'm dome making the gameplay.
- Make level(s) using my own [LDtkToUnity](https://github.com/Cammin/LDtkUnity) tool
- Potentially try [Unity's new pooling](https://docs.unity3d.com/2021.1/Documentation/ScriptReference/Pool.ObjectPool_1.html) options  

- Make a simple experience that follows the theme. Create what sounds most fun without overscope. I'm thinking of making a tile-based top-down action game.
