## Personal goals I've set out to do before starting:
- Learn Unity's new Input system better (Trying to learn how to use it simply instead of overengineering it due to not understanding the package enough)
- Make my own pixel art in Aseprite and integrate to Unity with [Aseprite2Unity](https://github.com/Seanba/Aseprite2Unity). Simple pixel art, and only after I'm done making the gameplay.
- Make level(s) using my own [LDtkToUnity](https://github.com/Cammin/LDtkUnity) tool
- Potentially try [Unity's new pooling](https://docs.unity3d.com/2021.1/Documentation/ScriptReference/Pool.ObjectPool_1.html) options  

- Make a simple experience that follows the theme. Create what sounds most fun without overscope. I'm thinking of making a tile-based top-down action game.

## Post Mortem
##### Things I did do
- I learnt how to use Unity's input system in an easier fashion than what i've done before. I assigned inspector fields for InputActionReference, and away we go!
- I accomplished Unity's new pooling system. I definitely spent too much time making the pooling where it could have been made faster without pooling, but I'm glad I did it.
- I composed music for the first time ever. The title screen's is a bit rubbish, but the gameplay's is alright.
- I did use Aseprite to make all of the art, and the import process into unity is flawless, It was done so much faster thanks to the Aseprite2Unity tool.
- I finished a bit early before the submission deadline, but I strongly set out to only achieve what I planned from the start, and it got finished relatively early. I did not want to come up without a finished game. This helped inform me on scoping a game's progress better nonetheless.

#### Things I didn't do
- After hearing about the theme and conjuring a game idea, LDtk level design would not fit too well for the game I was going for. It turned into an arcade-style high score game.
